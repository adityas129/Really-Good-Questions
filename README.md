# Really-Good-Questions
List of really good questions to create more meaningful conversations


After coming across https://lamaalrajih.com/2019/07/24/skip-the-small-talk-part-one/, and trying them out in my life and seeing how effective they truly are, I thought this could be effective as an open-source repo of really good questions that people contribute to in order to create a compendium of the the best of the best questions. Original questions are being posted with the permission of the author, Lama Al Rajih.
