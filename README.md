# Really-Good-Questions
List of really good questions to create more meaningful conversations


After coming across https://lamaalrajih.com/2019/07/24/skip-the-small-talk-part-one/, and trying them out in my life and seeing how effective they truly are, I thought this could be effective as an open-source repo of really good questions that people contribute to in order to create a compendium of the the best of the best questions. Original questions are being posted with the permission of the author, Lama Al Rajih. Also adding my own on top. 

An interactive web page coming real soon :)
